# Link In Bio

## A custom written link in bio page

What it says on the tin. A completely custom, whitelabeled link in bio page for content creators.

This project, celebrating GitHub's Codespaces launch (at least for me), was coded entirely using Codespaces, through a desktop instance of VSCode connected to a Codespace.

Maybe I'll work on this a bit more afterwards... Maybe...
